# Titanic EDA Project

## Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to understand factors influencing passenger survival rates. The analysis focuses on gender, passenger class, age, and embarkation port.

## Tools Used
- Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Excel: Pivot tables and charts

## Key Findings
1. **Gender**: Women had a significantly higher survival rate (70-80%) compared to men (20%).
2. **Passenger Class**: First-class passengers had a 60% survival rate, while third-class passengers had only a 20% survival rate.
3. **Age**: Young children (0-10 years) had a higher survival rate, while older passengers had lower survival rates.
4. **Embarkation Port**: Passengers from Cherbourg had the highest survival rate (50%).

## Visualizations
- Survival Rate by Gender

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required libraries: `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn`.
